Paneiou xxxi

begins with a brief chronology, starting from the year llyfflrm
1207 As the style and arrangement of the followingb &W
portion differs altogether from the earlier part, we can
scarcely suppose that it was drawn up by the same
writer; and we may, in deleult ol a more definite exa·
mination, assume thet the year 1210 marks a distinct
break. Under e similer reservetion we may be content
to accept the history of the first ten years of the thir-
teenth century as the work osone author, end I see at
present no strong resson to doubt thet it is the work of
Gervase. It is worth while observing that the very last
sentence of this part of the history conteins a quotation
oi which Gervase was very fond, ‘⁴ Nulla pestis efficacior

“ quam familiaris inimicus, ” end a reference tot the pro·
phecy of Merlin, to which also Gervase occasionally
resorted. Both these marks appear in the first peges of sim·
the Ohronicle, and seem to recur on the closing pege of⁰ epuo ιιιόίιι
this part of the Gesta. Another peculiarity of Ger-¹¹⁹⁹*
reses diction rs observeble ιιι these peges: the title
profectus Amplior, as given to the justiciar, rs, if not
peculier to Gervase, sorore in other writers as to escape
notice almost entirely. The lugubrious tone which
marks the earlier portion of the Chronicle is indeed
missing, end the sufferings of the monks of Christ
Church occupy a place in the conceive better propor-
tioned to the general course of history then to their
position in a separate chronicis of the convent; but both
these characteristico of the earlier‘work almost disap-
peer in the Gesta, even for the reigns of Henry ΙΙ. end
Richard I., so thet their absence at this point cannot be
made to support any definite conclusion. Itis possible
theta more minute examinationes this part of the work,
such as is scarcely possible except in the process of
printing, may reveal particulare of variation which may
modify this conclusion. But pending this investigation,
wo moy, I think, suppose Gervase to have continued the
ceucueyer 1210. ’
