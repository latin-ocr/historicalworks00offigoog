wc have scen was written at least as late as the year
1188.1 From the year 1186 onwards tho language oi
the Imaginationes coincides, as might be expected, very
closely with that of the Chronicle3 as the latter however
in 1188 becomes fuller and more continuone, it seems
unnecessary to throw the hypothetical period of com-

ffissffi' mencement later. lt is of course possible that tho lma·

ghhd-iffi ginationes may have been intended for a recapitulation
ffiffippg of the events previously recorded in the Chronicle3 but
”10¹0- this seems much less probable, nor on such a supposition
is it easy to explain why these particular episodes should
have been first treated in the Chroniclc on a scale so
disproportionate not only tc the general history of tho
time but to the other particulare concerning the fortunas
of the monastery. They could on this theory have ap·
peared in their completcness only in a minuto Chronicle of
the Oonvent, but Gervcse's Chroniole is sofar from being
a complete Chronicle of the Convent that he does not
evan give the exact or carclully dated sequence of the

priors of his own time. ,
ω If this argument bc good, we sec that the Chronicle
‘⁰¹¹¹ θ, 0f1143and 1150 was not written until the year 1188
⁰, attha earliest. A conclusion in the sama direction may
be drawn from tha examination of the materiale which
are used for the history oi S. Thomas. Garvase's account
oi the life and martyrdom of the great archbishopis
drawn from the Livas written by John of Salisbury‚
prior Alan, afterwards abbot of Tcwkesbury, William of
Canterbury and Herbert jof Bosham. lt is unnecessary
here to anticipato the conclusions of the learned Editor
of those works as to the exact relationes the several
biographies in respect of date and originality. Itis, how·
ever, certain that Herbert of Bosham was writing his
book at the time of the death of Geoffrey of Brittany
