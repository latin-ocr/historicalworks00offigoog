they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master of the Rolls with the sanction of the Treasury.

The Lords of Her Majesty’s Treasury, after a carcful
consideration ol the subject, expressed their opinion in a
Treasury Minute, dated February 9,,1857, that the plan
recommended by the Master of the Rolls “was well
calculated for tho accomplishment of this important .
⁴ national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
withinareasonable time, and provided proper attention be
paid to economy, in making the detailed arrangements,
without unnecessary expense.’'

They expressed their approbation of the proposal that
each Ghronicle and historical document should be edited

Ι in such a manner as to represent with all possible correct·

ness the textos each writer, derived from acollation of
the best MSS, and that no notes should be added, except
such as were illustrative of the various readings. They
suggested, however, that the preface to each work should
contain, in addition to the particulars proposed by the
Master of the Rolls, a biographical account oi the author,
sofar as authentic materiale existed for that purpose,
andan estimato of his historical credibility and value. ’
