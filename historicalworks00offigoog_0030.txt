either 11111 the original design was to write an account
of the great quarrel, and that the preliminary porticus

having taken up the pen of the annalist in 1188, Gervase
found the events and dates of the three preceding years
present 10 his memory or within easy resch. To· his
own memory or to that of some of his fellow monks he
must have been indebtcd for the few minute points of

we have a distinct proof of the important position which
he had now reached. He was sent with a deputation of
