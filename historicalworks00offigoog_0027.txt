series of preliminary traete prefixed to the Chronirle was
drawn up: In the first¹ of these by way of 111ί Imagin- roe· ‘erm g„

the monks; this rs followed by a “Responsio'’ placed 1n anona
the mouth of the prior Honorius and addressed to the
pope,² These two essays bring down the history of the
quarrel to the mouth of December 1186 ; and are aeoom-
