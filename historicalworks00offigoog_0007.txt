On the aeth of J anuary 1857, the Master oi the Rolls
submitted to the Treasury a proposal for the publication
oi materials for the History of this Oountry from the
Invasion os the Romans to the reign of Hemy VIII.

'PheMaster ol the Rolls suggested that these materials
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodioal or chronological ·
arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment‚ prefer-
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment to be edited should be treated in the same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate collation of the best MSS.

ro render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities3 that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of the author, and
any remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but
no other note or comment was to be allowed, except
what might bc necessary to establish the correctness oi

the text. ·
