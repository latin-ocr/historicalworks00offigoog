tc be the earliest dats assignable as the starting point ol
Gervase's literary activity.

liiffiii'di‘ In December 1184 Archbishop Baldwin was elected to

pem„ the primacy, after a series of negotiatione, disputes, and

1110111184· intrigues, such as almost invariably attended the deci·

sion of a point which was in constant debete between

the king, the convent, and the comprovincial bishops.

The circumstantial account which Gervase gives of this

transaction1 proves not only that he had, as one of the

maturer memhors of the conventual body, his share in

tha election, hut that he had begun to take a vivid in-

terest in the questions connected with the rights and

prerogatives of the mother church. It was that vivid

· · interest, and the carelul investigation oi all points con-

nected with the subject, that fitted him to he the his·

torian of the house, and that gives to this Chronicle, the

Atumdaor most important of his works, its essential character. He

diffidis writes throughout as the ohampion of the oathedral con-

{ileliae vent against the whole world, and especially against the
archbishop, wherever the interests of the archbishop and
convent are opposed. Where there is no such opposition
he is willing to act and write as the arohbishop's cham·
pion, and his interest is never more vivid, or his argu-
ment stronger, than where the rights ol the archbishop
and convent are identical. Such a case was that in·
volved in the obedience oi the abbot of S. Augustine’s,
whose attempts to throw off the authority of the arch·
bishop were levclled as much against the prerogativa of
the cathedral as against that of the primate. Such,
again, was the case of the monks of Rochester, who, in
trying to evade the customary ohservances by which
their predecessore had recognised their dependence on
the archbishop, had broken through customs of which

the convent of Canterbury was consistently tenacious.²
