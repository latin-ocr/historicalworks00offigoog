These scanty indications point to the conclusion that

Gervase was probably au inmate of the convent during

“ this important period, and must even have witnessed

some part of the closing scenas: but that, as he did not

entertain the idea of writing a history until more than

twenty years afterwards, and by that time his recol-

lectione must have lost any sharpness or clearness that

they had ever had, he thought it wiser tc adopt the words,

and piece together a narrative of patchvvork from the

writings, of the earlier biographers‚ than to attempt an

εοοὶηᾶερθιιάθυι narrative of his own. His Chronicle dces

reiice- certainly exhibit such an amount of careful selection as

proves him tohave had an independent recollection of the

sequence of events: even the errors of arrangement which

may be detected in it seem to bc the errors of a man

misled by an effert of his own memory. Gervase's nar·

rutivc, then, has the value that belongs to confirmative

evidence3 he, having been on the spot and having seen

some pert of what he recorda, deliberately gives an

account of it in borrowed words. This theory, however,

is of no great importance. The critical parts of Becket's

history took place far away from Canterbury3 and, as

we have said, it is scarcely conceivable thetis Gervase

saw the murder, he should have abstnined from declar-

ing himself an eye-witness. We conclude, then, that in

a humble capacity, as a junior monk, he was probably
resident at Christ Church from 1163 to 1170.
