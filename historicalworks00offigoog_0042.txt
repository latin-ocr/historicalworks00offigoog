a little body of Chichester men, two of whom are men-
tioned with him, Jordan of Meleburn, the archdeacon,
and Matthew, both of whom were subsequently deans of
Chichestcr. None of the three attended S. Thomas in
his exile. If this were all that was known of Gervase
of Ohichester it might afford a fair presumption that he
was the same person as Gervase of Canterbury3 both
were attached to S. Thomas, both were young scholare
under his influence3 neither followed him into exile.
But the resemblance goes no farther3 and what little rs
known of Gervasc of Chichester rs conclusive. Without
following Leland and Bale in their assertion that he was
a student at Paris and famous as a preacher of morality,8

commentary on Malachi in which, in a poetica} intro-
duction, he describes S. Thomas as a model of the
priestly life. He is said by Bale to have written alife
of S. Thomas, and such an inferente may possibly be
drawn from the verses which Sir Thomas D. Hardy has
printed in the second volume of the Materials for British
History, pages 351 and 352. This biography, which
according to Leland was cited by Helias of Evesham, in
his life of the martyr, has long been sorrght for in vain.
The work,3 existing in MS. in the Imperial Library of
Paris, and ascribed by Gale to Servaeo of Chichester, is
identical with that published by Dr. Giles as the work

attended S. Thomas in his exile, and cannot therefore be
