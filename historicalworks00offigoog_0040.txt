wasadpart It must romain an open question whether the portion
{ffigm ιι cuer pmrof the‘ ‘Gesta Regumss’ of which we have been treating, '
ω l‚evrvr'lss is or is not an abridgment of a largcr continuation of
the Chronicle This question can only be discussed with
advantage when the Gesta Regum themselves are before
us. At present I feel inclined to the opinion that such
a continuation, although distinctly contemplated, was
never written, and that we have in the Gesta rather
notes made in preparation for a continuation than sn
abridgment of such a work. It will be necessary in ths
Introduction to the second volume to examine what
’ other materials are now in existence which' may have
been collected in the prospectos such c continuation,
either by Gervese or by some of his sellun-monks.
ο The ancient obituaries ol the convent contain several
' notes oi the obits of monks bearing the name of Gervase.
One of these, now the Cotton MS NeroO ix, which
belongs to the early years of the thirteenth century,
places the commemorationes a Gervase, priest and monk,
ont the lst of Januery, and thet of another similarly
described on the 14th of March.¹ The later Centerbury ¹
Martyrology,p1eservedin MS. at Lambeth, commemo-
ratas a third Gervase² on the 30th of April. We have
no evidence to show which of these notices belongs to
our author, or tc what years they are severally to be
referred

from that of other literary men and public servants of
his time Few ss the recorded facts may seem, they are
sufficiently distinctive; but the very paucity tuf detail
has invited speculatione which have tended to identify
