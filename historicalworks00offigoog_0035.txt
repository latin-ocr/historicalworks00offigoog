book of Chronicles and the beginning of the secondJGg lmigss
But we have no evidence to show that the second was ”dmg
ever written, and't rt is certain that if it ever were written
it rs now lost. The account given in the Chronicle of
the death of Richard seems to be strictly contemporary3
and, in fact, to eontain some statements of names and
events which might on later information bave been made
more definite and correct. Nor are there in the peges
which precede the close any anticipatione of later history
which might be made to show that the book was drawn
up at a somewhat later period. The ‘'‘ Tribulatio Eccle-

as the history might eonvey-were to be found in the
second book, a sure token that it was as yet only in

dynasties, and of the Nonnan and Angevin reigns down
to the reign of John; to he followed hy a history of
Canterbury and its arohhishops to the time of Hubert

added asmall tract on the politioal and ecclesiastical
geography of Britain, to which he appended a somewhst
scanty “Provinciam’' of the Catholie Ohurch entitling

are still in manuscript, and will, it is hoped soon be
