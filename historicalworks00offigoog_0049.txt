of 601. lod. as chaplain of Westminster;¹ on the asch of emperie
1111011205 he rs presented 101110 perpetual curaey of S 22⁸&th n’s
S Mary'a Cambridge, as Gorvasius‘ ‘capellanus nostersr ymerum

de Westmuster‚’' and on the rand of December of the

same year, the king granta to Baldwin ol London clerk

of the Enchequer, his ehaplainey of S. Stephen’s West-

minster which had belonged 10 Gervase the chaplain.

Itis, I think, probable from this that Gervase the
clerk of the chancellor subsequently became writer of ’
che great Roll of the Exchequer and chaplain of S.
Stephen's, the royal chapel which was close to the
Enchequer3 and that he is the Gervasius 1ο whom the
authorship of the Dialogus'de Scaocario was afterwards
ascribed, and ivho was bya double mistakc identified
with Gervase of Tilbury. How it came to pass that the
Dialogus was ever ascribed to a person named Gervase,
it ia out of my province here to conjecture ;3 Madox has
proved that the real author was Richard son of Bishop
Nigel‚ the Treasurer, and the question does not concern us
further. But it maybe as well 10 point out that Gervasc
of Tilbury although ‘¹ Magister,’'a clerk, and a married ’
man could not have been identical with the writer of
the great Roll.

Gervase of Tilbury rs best known as the writer 01111010
the Otia Imperialia, written about the year 1211,andd}⁸r¹31al¹lr
dedicated to the emperor Otto IV. who had made himas
marshal of the kingdom of Arles. In that work he
gives no tices of his previous career which show that
he was employed in study abroad 01 in other em-
ployments incompatible with en Exchequer office in
anland. He had lived at Rome as a boy,4 and had
seen a good deal of Italy. He was at Venice at the
time of the pacification between Alexander ΙΙΙ. and
