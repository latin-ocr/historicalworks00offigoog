ἵξῃ· coincidences between this book and the narrative of Ger-

a few places ιιι which Gervase slavishly follows the
wordingof his authority, and ιι seems most probable that,
when he reached a period over which his own memory
ranged with fair aocurmy, he gave the story in his own
words. Itis to be observedthat, on all matters on which
the older chronicle is silent, Gervase's remarks are ex·
tremely meagre. Beyond this it is impossible to suggest
any new sources of information from which our author
dreW, over and above those used in the earlier parts of
the work, the recorda of his convent and occasional
letters from abroad. As he approached the time at which
he wrote he would naturally draw more and more on
his own recollectione, and, from the point at which
his narrative became contemporaneous, we look for no
additional authority. It is unfortunate that from that
point, the interest of his chroniole becomes narrowed and
restricted until, for several most eventiul years, it is
absolutely confined to the internal concems of the
monastery.

not long before¹ and not long after the time of Gervase,
when such indicatione would have much meaning. The
old national spirit lingered long in the monasteries of
the twelfth century, and the new national spirit, os
exemplified in men like Matthew Paris, flourished early
