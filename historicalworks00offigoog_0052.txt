which 11 11 inserted on the authority of the Abbot of
Winchelcomb, and which re extant rn the library of
Corpus Christi Collega, Oxford. Another source of infor-
mation which has become known 10 us since the cor-
responding portion 01 the present volume was printed,
was perhaps the chronicle of Saint Augrrstine’s, extend·
ing 1ο the ycar 1179, edited by Dr. Liebermanu in the
“ Ungedruckte Angla-Nomannische Geschichtequellen”
From this work or from common materiale Gervose took
his account of the conflagratione of 1137, which are
described in nearly the same words in the annale ol
Rochester (p. 100); the eclipsc of 1140, which he places
in 1139 (p. 10911011 possibly the date of queen Matilda's
death (p. 151).

tinctly marked by' rgnorance of the precise dates, that it
must be indisputably referred 10 some earlier authority.
Although the correspondcnce in language with the “ His·
toria Pontificalis,” assigned 10 J ohn of Salishury, is not
so marked as 10 decide the question beyond doubt, it
may reasonably bc conjectured that a source so acces-
sible would 11 used by Gervasa and that the common
material was thence horrowed by him. If allowanoe be
made for the use of all these authorities for the reign of

Stephcn, it will bc found that ior that period little remains
of which Gervsse could pretend 10 be the original re·
corder. The dates and circumstances of the consecration
of bishops, which he gives occasionally in defiancc of the
true chronology‚ he no doubt found, where they are still
to he found, endorsed on the professione of obedience²
