phical character, and the title of “Mappa Mundi,¹’
which Gervase of Canterbury gives to one ol his werke,
might be assigned with far more justice ιο one important
section of the Otia Imperialia. But although the careers

of the two were so widely spart, both of them seem to

have been confounded at times with another Gervase,

who again was neither Gervase of Chichester nor Gervase servm.
of S. Generi. The clerk of the chancery who attended iiidoflcim·
Becket in France in 1158,1 bore the name of Gervase, Μ’·
and was probably identical with that Gervase, writer of

the great roll of the Exchequer, whose connexion with
Exchequer business caused the famous “Dialogus de
Scaccario” to be ascribed ιο a Gervase, who again is
identified with Gervase of Tilbmy.

The name of Gervase, whether or no we are justified
in believing it ιο ιο the same Gervase throughout,
appears more or less frequently throughout the whole
reign of Henry. II. in connexion with the business of
the Exchequer Gervase “de Thesauro ’' is mentioned in
the accounts of the and and 4th years of the reign as
quit ol Danegeld, donum comitatus, and murder fines,
within the county of Southampton ; a notice which
shows that he was in the service cf the Exchequer and
possessed of land in the county: and in the 15th year
he is again excused of a murder fine. The name occurs
also in the Berkshire accounts of 1156ss Whether the
Gervase who rendere account for the ferm of London and
Middlesex in the same year is identical with Gervase de
Thesauro, or was an ancestor of the house of Cornhill,
Ido not pretend to say, These entries however prove
that in 1158 there was a servant or clerk of the treasury,
who might very naturally be in attendanoe on the
chancellor in Normandy. For it must be remembered
