have found in his recollectione so little that was worth {ffgdffilg‘}

moording in his own words. In point of fact, with very {mim

minute exceptions, the whole of the materiale which he ffiffiiem,

has used for this part of his Chroniole are horrowcd from

the biographies of William of Canterbury, John of Salis·

bury, 11166 61 Tewksahury and Herbert of Bosham.

That this was the case, and not the converse, seems
tolerably certain, os we shall see, from the dates at

which these biographers finished their labours3 dates

which precede by several years the point of timeat which y
Gervase began to write. Yet that Gervase regarded him·

sellas an independent biographer of the martyr is evi·

dent hom the way in which, although in the usual apo-

logetio tone in which he speaks of himself, he mentions

his own work among the authorities for S. Thomas's
history.l It may, morcover, be inferred from the fcwssssssfflg,
particulare oi Canterbury news which occur here andillhmilhi,
thero during these years, that he was throughout the 1111111101·
time an inmate of the cathedral convent. This may ac·

count for the prominenoe which he gives to the conduct

of Prior Wibcrt, a picus ecclesiastic, who scarcely appears

stall in the biographies, but who naturally would be the

great man ol the age inthe estimation of a young monk

of his own society 3² the severe stricturae, tce, on the
conduct of Randuli del Broc, seem to he the utterance of

one who had personally suffered from his contumely or
oppression⁸ Although Gervase does not speak of him-

self as an eye-witness of the martyrdom, us he almost to

a certainty would have donchad he been on the spot at

the time, he does speak aa having been present at the

burisl, which took place the next day.⁴ On the other
