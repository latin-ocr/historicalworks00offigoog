In 01011010, 1110100101, 10 which the 1000101 authority m. ,oram
00111001 was likely to come into 0011101οο 011 111 the archi· 1110110110 a
episcopal, whether that 0000101 authority wast that 01
the king, the justinae, 01 1110 0110111101 11001, (1011000,
provided the convent was not concernat, was oonsist
ently on the side 01 1110 archbishop. It cannot, indeed,
be asserted that his authority was very great: he was
001000000101, and shows little acquaintance with eccle-1
010011001 history, but he was a 0010101 student 01 the
antiquities 01 1110 own monastery, andan intelligent
and aealous assertor 01 1101 rights.

The 11101 00000100 00 which 11010 ttempted 1001011001Ηοη gnatus

writing must have been the disputo between the arch- {egr} aha

bishop and the ahbot 01 S Augustines which beganMu 1121101’ '11¹¹
about the year 1178 and was continued until the year 1
1183, in the March 01 which year the king affected a

pacification between archbishop Richard and the abbot.l
The 11001110 which Gervase oontributed to 1110 literature
01 1110 quarrelis drawn up in the 10110 01 an “ Imaginatio ”
01 “case'’ on behalf 01 1110 archbishop. Its language is
very general and affords little evidence 10100 exact date;
101 although itis entitled as intended 10 be spoken in the
consistory 01 Alexander ΙΙΙ., before the year 1181, Arch-
bishop Richard is spoken 01 in such a tone 01 historical
retrospection that it would seem probabis that he was
dead at the time. 11 that were 11101001 1110 “ Imaginatio ’⁷ ·
must have been either a mere exercise on a disputa
already closed, 01 0 case drawn up in contemplation 01
0101100101 01 1110 struggle. Such a renewal might be
attempted by any new archbishop or on the accession
01 any new pope: and, in fact, both Baldwin end Hubert
had grievances against S. Augustine’s, whilst Urban III. ’
and Celestine III. were both called on 10 confirm the
privileges which had been gentes by Alexander III.
