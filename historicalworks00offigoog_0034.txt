him from the duty of service altogether. It is perhaps
necessary tc point out further, although the remark
really leads to nothing, that there arc words in the pro·
logue to tho Chronicle which might be interpreted to
imply that at the time of its composition Gervasc had
been taken away from Canterbury; he writes, as he
says, not for any publio library, “ but for thee, brother
“ Thomas, and our poor little family,’' “ nostrae familiola

eommunity of Christ Church aa “familiola paupercule,”
is to use a form of rneiosis which is scarcely recon-
cileable with sincere humility. The words would be
applicable enough to Dover, if we could suppose that
our author had been transferred to S. Martin's3 there
are many references in the body of the Chronicle to the
fortunes of that dependency or cell of Christ Chureh;
and one portion of Cervase's works, as will appear from
the contents of our second volume, was very closely con·
nected with Dover. But this notionis illusory: the
list of the priora of Dover is perfect and consecutive for
this peri0d; Felix is the prior appointed in 1197, and
on his death in 1212 a successor named Reginald was
appointed.² There is no room for Gervase, and, as seems
tc follow from the notices in the obitumy of the convent,
he died a simple monk of Christ Chureh. The conclu·
sion must be that he resigned the sacristan¹s place altera
short tenure, and devoted himself thenceforward mainly
to the composition of his Chronioles. Beyond the slight
indicatione of life and vigour which they supply we
have no further evidence that illustrates his history.
Cervase lived tc see the cnd of the reign of Richard
end the beginning of that of John. He regarded that
epoch as an appropriate point for the end of his first
