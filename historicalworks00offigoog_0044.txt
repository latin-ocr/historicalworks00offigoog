iissffl'i'd' many 01 them conceming the English houses of the order.

Among his letters ‘is found 0110 addressed by e third
ι person to Benedict, abbot of the Premonstretcnsien

The dete of the promotion of Gervdse to the ebbscy of
S. Just fulls about the end 01 the twelfth century; in
1209 he became ebbot 01 Premontre, und 110 wns bishop
of Seez from 1220 to 1228.2 On what authority he is
called Gervese 01 Ohichester does notappeer3 but, es heis
said te heve written commentaries on the minor prophete,
his history must heve been eonfounded with that of the
true Gervase 01 Chichester. He was probably 0 scholar
of Puris, end hence the assertion of Lelnnd thet Gervcse 01
chichester studied there tce. The confusion is probably

, es old ss the nge of Lelsnd, but there 0011 be no doubt
thot the bishop 01 Seez of 1228 cannot 11010 been the
promising scholar of Chichester of 1161.
